        <p>Clean drains are the foundation of a healthy plumbing system. Yakima Plumbing Co offers professional drain cleaning services throughout Yakima, WA, and we have seen firsthand how good maintenance habits prevent costly problems. Here are our top drain cleaning tips that actually work.</p>
<h2>The Simplest Prevention Tool</h2>
<p>Drain screens and hair catchers are the single most effective preventive tool for keeping drains clear. These inexpensive mesh or silicone screens sit over or inside the drain opening and catch hair, food particles, and debris before they enter the pipe. Install them on every shower drain, bathtub drain, bathroom sink, and kitchen sink. Clean them after each use or at least several times per week.</p>
<p>For kitchen sinks, use a fine mesh strainer that catches even small food particles. For shower drains, silicone hair catchers with suction cups work well and are easy to clean. For bathroom sinks, a simple pop-up drain strainer keeps hair and soap residue from accumulating in the drain pipe. The few seconds it takes to clean a drain screen after each use saves you hours of dealing with clogs and drain cleaning products down the road.</p>
<p>Replacing a clogged drain screen is always cheaper than paying for a drain cleaning service. Most screens cost between two and ten dollars and last for years.</p>
<h2>The Baking Soda and Vinegar Method</h2>
<p>For routine maintenance cleaning, the baking soda and vinegar method is safe, effective, and inexpensive. Once a month, pour half a cup of baking soda down each drain, followed by half a cup of white vinegar. The combination creates a fizzing reaction that helps break down grease, soap scum, and organic buildup on the pipe walls. Let it fizz for 15 to 30 minutes, then flush thoroughly with very hot water.</p>
<p>For kitchen drains where grease is the primary concern, follow the baking soda and vinegar treatment with a pot of boiling water poured slowly down the drain. The boiling water helps melt and flush grease that the baking soda and vinegar loosened. Do not pour boiling water down drains with PVC pipes or garbage disposals, as the extreme heat can damage PVC joints. Very hot tap water (as hot as your faucet produces) is sufficient and safe for all pipe types.</p>
<p>This natural method is far safer for your pipes than chemical drain cleaners and is effective for maintenance cleaning. It will not clear a fully blocked drain, but performed regularly, it helps prevent blockages from forming in the first place.</p>

<h2>Keep Your Kitchen Drain Flowing</h2>
<p>Your garbage disposal and kitchen drain are connected, and how you use the disposal directly affects drain health. Always run cold water before, during, and for at least 15 seconds after using the disposal. Cold water solidifies fats and grease so they can be ground up and flushed away rather than coating your drain pipe walls as a warm, sticky residue.</p>
<p>Feed food waste into the disposal gradually. Stuffing a large amount in at once can overwhelm the grinding mechanism and create a paste-like clog in the drain line below. Let the disposal process each batch fully before adding more. Never put grease, oil, fibrous vegetables, starchy foods, coffee grounds, or bones into the disposal. These items are the primary causes of kitchen drain clogs.</p>
<p>Clean the disposal regularly with ice cubes and rock salt to scrub the grind chamber, and deodorize with citrus peels. A clean, well-maintained disposal means a cleaner, freer-flowing kitchen drain.</p>
<h2>Why You Should Avoid Chemical Drain Cleaners</h2>
<p>Despite their popularity, chemical drain cleaners are not recommended by professional plumbers. These products work by generating heat through caustic chemical reactions to dissolve organic clogs. The problem is that the same heat and chemistry that dissolves the clog also attacks your pipes. PVC pipes can soften and deform, metal pipes corrode faster, and pipe joints and seals deteriorate.</p>
<p>Repeated use of chemical cleaners accelerates pipe aging and can actually create leaks. The products are also dangerous to store and handle. They can cause severe chemical burns on skin contact, produce toxic fumes in enclosed spaces like under-sink cabinets, and create dangerous situations if mixed with other cleaning products even accidentally. If a chemical cleaner fails to clear the clog, the plumber who comes to fix the problem faces additional risk working with a pipe full of caustic chemicals.</p>
<p>Enzyme-based drain cleaners are a safer alternative. These products use natural bacteria and enzymes to digest organic matter in the drain. They work more slowly than chemical cleaners but are safe for all pipe types, non-toxic, and effective for maintenance cleaning. They are not strong enough to clear a full blockage but work well as a regular preventive treatment.</p>

<h2>How to Use a Plunger Effectively</h2>
<p>A plunger is the first tool to reach for when a drain clogs. For sinks and tubs, use a cup plunger (the flat-bottomed kind, not the flanged toilet plunger). Fill the sink or tub with enough water to cover the plunger cup. If the fixture has an overflow opening, block it with a wet rag to maintain pressure. Place the plunger squarely over the drain, ensuring a good seal, and plunge vigorously with 15 to 20 quick thrusts. The pressure and suction cycle dislodges most minor clogs.</p>
<p>For double kitchen sinks, block the drain on the opposite side with a wet rag or stopper before plunging. Without blocking the other side, the pressure escapes through the adjacent drain and the plunger is ineffective. For toilets, use a flange plunger (the type with an extended rubber flap that fits into the toilet drain opening) for a better seal and more effective plunging.</p>
<p>If plunging does not clear the clog after several attempts, move on to a drain snake rather than reaching for chemical cleaners. A hand-operated drain snake can reach 15 to 25 feet into the pipe and physically break up or retrieve the clog material.</p>
<h2>When Professional Drain Cleaning Is Needed</h2>
<p>While regular maintenance and basic tools handle most drain issues, some situations require professional equipment and expertise. Call a professional if multiple drains are slow or clogged simultaneously, which indicates a main line problem. If a clog returns within weeks of clearing it, there is likely an obstruction deeper in the line that surface methods are not reaching. Sewage odors from drains, water backing up into other fixtures, or gurgling sounds throughout the plumbing all point to problems that need professional diagnosis.</p>
<p>Professional drain cleaning methods include motorized drain snakes that can reach 100 feet or more into a pipe, and hydro jetting, which uses a high-pressure water stream at 3,000 to 4,000 PSI to scour the entire interior of the pipe. Hydro jetting is the most thorough drain cleaning method available and removes grease, scale, roots, and debris that no household tool can address. After cleaning, a sewer camera inspection verifies the line is clear and checks for any pipe damage that needs attention.</p>
